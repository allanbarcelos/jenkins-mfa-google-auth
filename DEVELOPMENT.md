## Handling Security Reports

When receiving a vulnerability report:
1. Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. Work with Jenkins Security Team if needed
3. Prepare a fix in a private repository if necessary
4. Coordinate disclosure timing
5. Release an updated version following [Jenkins security release process](https://www.jenkins.io/security/for-maintainers/)
